"""This script contains an example for how to train a network for
a segmentation task with SynapseNet. This script covers the case of
supervised training, i.e. your data needs to contain annotations for
the structures you want to segment. If you want to use domain adaptation
to adapt an already trained network to your data without the need for
additional annotations then check out `domain_adaptation.py`.

You can download example data for this script from:
TODO zenodo link to Single-Ax / Chemical Fix data.
