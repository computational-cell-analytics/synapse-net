"""This script contains an example for using domain adptation to
transfer a trained model for vesicle segmentation to a new dataset from a different data distribution,
e.g. data from regular transmission electron microscopy (2D) instead of electron tomography or data from
a different electron tomogram with different specimen and sample preparation.
You don't need any annotations in the new domain to run this script.

You can download example data for this script from:
- Adaptation to 2d TEM data: TODO zenodo link
- Adaptation to different tomography data: TODO zenodo link
