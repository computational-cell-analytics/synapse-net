# TODO implement analysis pipeline for our tomo sample data:
# - segment vesicles, AZ, and compartment
# - use compartment segmentation to find the presynaptic terminal
# - postprocess the AZ segmentation
# - measure distances between vesicles and AZ
# - vesicle pool assignment into docked and non-attached terminals
# - export table with distance and morphology measurements for the two pools
