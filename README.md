# SynapseNet: Deep Learning for Automatic Synapse Reconstruction

SynapseNet is a tool for segmentation and analysis of synapses in electron microscopy.

To learn how to use SynapseNet, check out [the documentation](https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/synapse-net/) and [the tutorial video](https://youtu.be/7n8Oq1uAByE).
To learn more about how it works, check out [our publication](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E24-11-0519).

See an example reconstruction of a mossy fibre synapse with SynapseNet.
Automatic segmentation of synaptic vesicles are rendered in orange, active zones in blue and two mitochondria in red and cyan.
