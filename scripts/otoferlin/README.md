# Otoferlin Analysis


## Notes on improvements:

- Try less than 20 exclude slices
- Update boundary post-proc (not robust when PD not found and selects wrong objects)
- Can we find fiducials with ilastik and mask them out? They are interfering with Ribbon finding.
    - Alternative: just restrict the processing to a center crop by default.
